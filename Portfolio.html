                <p>I am a geography student at the Unversity of Wisconsin Eau-Claire. I am originally from a small town in the Northwoods of Wisconsin where most of my family still resides. I moved to Eau Claire Wisconsin for school nearly 5 years ago and have called it my home since. My interests are in the field of GIS and technology applications within a geographical context. I also enjoy outdoor recreation activities such as rock climbing, mountain biking, and nordic skiing. </p>
